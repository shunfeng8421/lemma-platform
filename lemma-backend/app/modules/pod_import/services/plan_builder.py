"""Turn a bundle on disk into an ordered import plan.

This is the server-side counterpart of the CLI's plan: it walks the bundle in
dependency order, decides create-vs-update against what the pod already has, and
flags the table updates that would lose data — reusing ``lemma_pod_bundle`` so
the CLI and backend classify resources and destruction identically.

The "what already exists" question is a port (``ExistingResources``) so this
stays pure and unit-testable: tests pass a fake, production passes an adapter
over the pod's repositories.
