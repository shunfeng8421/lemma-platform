"""Ports for pod-import module boundaries.

The apply loop depends on two abstractions so it stays pure and testable: a
repository to persist the aggregate after every checkpoint, and a resource
applier that knows how to realize a single step against the target pod. The
real implementations (SQLAlchemy repository, backend-service-backed applier)
live in infrastructure; the service loop never names them.
